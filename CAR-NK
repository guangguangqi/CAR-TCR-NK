#1 Tumor Antigen Discovery (Multi-omics)
1.1 WGS / WES (tumor–normal)

Purpose

Genetic stability of candidate antigen genes

Detect:

Copy-number loss (antigen escape risk)

Truncating mutations

Tumor-specific amplification

Safety: avoid germline-expressed or essential genes

Key difference vs CAR-T

CAR-NK programs accept slightly lower tumor specificity because NK cells are safer (less CRS, no GvHD)

1.2 Bulk RNA-seq

Purpose

Confirm antigen is:

Highly expressed in tumor

Low or absent in essential normal tissues

Tumor vs normal comparison

1.3 Single-cell RNA-seq

Purpose

Validate:

Expression across tumor subclones

Avoid expression in critical normal cell populations

Identify tumor–immune ecosystem

1.4 Proteomics / Surfaceome (critical)

Purpose

Confirm antigen is:

On the cell surface

Accessible to CAR binding

Common methods:

Cell surface biotinylation

Mass-spec surfaceome profiling

Flow cytometry validation

🔑 For CAR-NK, surface density matters more than absolute specificity

##########
##2 NK-Relevant Antigen Prioritization (CAR-NK Specific)

CAR-NK can leverage NK innate biology, not just CAR binding.

Additional filters:

Antigens associated with:

Stress ligands

Tumor metabolic dysregulation

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

Expression correlated with:

Low MHC-I (NK sensitivity)

Interferon stress signatures

##########
###3 Antibody Discovery (BCR-seq / scBCR)
3.1 Bulk BCR-seq

Purpose

Identify antibodies recognizing:

Tumor antigens

Stress-induced surface proteins

3.2 scBCR + scRNA-seq

Purpose

Pair:

Antibody sequence (BCR)

B-cell activation phenotype

Select:

High-affinity, naturally selected antibodies

Output

scFv sequences for CAR design

##########
####4 CAR Design (NK-Optimized)
CAR-NK ≠ CAR-T
Component	CAR-T	CAR-NK
scFv	Same	Same
Hinge	CD8α	Often shorter
Transmembrane	CD28	NKG2D / CD16
Signaling domain	CD3ζ + CD28 / 4-1BB	DAP10 / DAP12 + CD3ζ

Key NK signaling adaptors

DAP10

DAP12

FcεRIγ

##########
#####5 NK Cell Source Selection (Critical Difference)
Common CAR-NK sources:

NK-92 cell line

Off-the-shelf

Irradiated before infusion

Cord blood NK cells

High proliferative capacity

iPSC-derived NK cells

Best for scalability

Peripheral blood NK cells

🔑 CAR-NK enables allogeneic “off-the-shelf” therapy, unlike CAR-T

##########
#######6 Functional Validation (Multi-omics Feedback Loop)
6.1 In vitro killing assays

Tumor vs normal cells

Cytotoxicity without cytokine storm

6.2 Single-cell profiling (scRNA-seq)

Validate:

NK activation states

Exhaustion markers

Cytokine profiles

6.3 scCAR-seq (optional)

CAR expression heterogeneity

Clonal expansion

##########
########7 Safety & Efficacy Profiling
Safety

Lower CRS risk

No GvHD

Shorter persistence → safer

Efficacy trade-off

Less persistence than CAR-T

Often combined with:

IL-15 engineering

Checkpoint blockade

Combination therapy

##########
##########8 Manufacturing & Clinical Translation

GMP CAR insertion (viral or transposon)

Cryopreservation

Off-the-shelf deployment
