TCR-T Discovery and Engineering Pipeline

Core principle:
TCR-T targets peptide–HLA complexes, not surface proteins.
Therefore, the pipeline is centered on antigen presentation, HLA restriction, and T-cell functionality.

1️⃣ WES / WGS — Neoantigen definition and genetic stability

Purpose:
To define tumor-specific antigens and assess their genetic robustness.

What we evaluate:

Somatic mutations generating candidate neoantigens

Truncating mutations or loss of the source gene

Copy-number loss or LOH affecting antigen genes

HLA genotype and LOH at HLA loci

Why it matters for TCR-T:

TCRs recognize mutant peptides presented by HLA

Genetic instability or HLA loss leads to immune escape

Decision enabled:

Is this antigen genetically stable and presented in an HLA-competent context?

2️⃣ Bulk RNA-seq — Antigen expression and pathway context

Purpose:
To confirm that the neoantigen-encoding gene is transcriptionally expressed in tumor cells.

What we evaluate:

Expression of mutant vs wild-type alleles

Tumor-specific expression patterns

Pathway dependency (driver vs passenger mutation)

Why it matters for TCR-T:

No expression → no peptide → no TCR recognition

Expression consistency improves therapeutic durability

Decision enabled:

Is the antigen actually expressed at a level sufficient for presentation?

3️⃣ (Optional) Immunopeptidomics / In silico MHC binding

Purpose:
To assess whether candidate peptides are likely to be presented on HLA molecules.

What we evaluate:

Predicted MHC binding affinity

Peptide processing likelihood

(If available) direct MS evidence of presentation

Why it matters for TCR-T:

Not all mutations generate presented peptides

Presentation is the key bottleneck in TCR-T

Decision enabled:

Is this peptide likely to appear on the tumor cell surface as peptide–HLA?

4️⃣ Bulk TCR-seq — Clonotype discovery and immune selection

Purpose:
To identify expanded TCR clonotypes that may recognize tumor antigens.

What we evaluate:

Clonal expansion in tumor or peripheral blood

V(D)J usage and CDR3 sequences

Repertoire skewing and convergence

Why it matters for TCR-T:

Expanded clonotypes suggest antigen-driven selection

Provides candidate TCR sequences for downstream validation

Decision enabled:

Which TCR clonotypes are likely tumor-reactive?

5️⃣ scTCR + scRNA-seq — Functional validation of TCRs

Purpose:
To link TCR sequence with T-cell functional state at single-cell resolution.

What we evaluate:

Cytotoxic vs exhausted vs bystander phenotypes

Activation markers and effector gene programs

Clonotype-specific functional profiles

Why it matters for TCR-T:

Expanded ≠ functional

Only cytotoxic, tumor-reactive T cells are suitable for engineering

Decision enabled:

Which TCRs are both antigen-specific and functionally competent?

6️⃣ TCR α/β pairing and sequence selection

Purpose:
To define the exact α/β TCR pair for engineering.

What we evaluate:

Correct chain pairing

Sequence features linked to specificity or cross-reactivity

Developability and manufacturability risks

Why it matters for TCR-T:

Incorrect pairing alters specificity

Cross-reactivity is a major safety concern

Decision enabled:

Which TCR sequence is safe and suitable for engineering?

7️⃣ TCR engineering and vector design — Transition to development

Purpose:
To optimize the TCR for expression, stability, and safety.

What we evaluate:

Affinity tuning (avoid supra-physiological binding)

Mispairing prevention strategies

Vector expression and signaling behavior

Why it matters for TCR-T:

Over-affinity increases off-target toxicity

Engineering quality directly impacts clinical safety

Decision enabled:
