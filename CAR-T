#############
####1  WES / WGS – Genetic stability and safety constraints

Purpose:
To determine whether a candidate antigen is genetically stable and safe to target.

What we evaluate:

Loss-of-function or truncating mutations in the antigen gene

Copy-number loss or subclonal deletions

Genomic instability that could lead to antigen escape

Why it matters for CAR-T:

CAR-T requires persistent surface antigen expression

If tumor cells can lose the antigen genetically, the therapy will fail

Decision enabled:

Is this antigen genetically reliable across patients and tumor subclones?

##############
###2 Bulk RNA-seq – Tumor-selective expression and mechanism

Purpose:
To confirm that the antigen is highly expressed in tumor tissue and low or absent in critical normal tissues.

What we evaluate:

Tumor vs normal differential expression

Expression across disease subtypes

Pathway context (oncogenic dependency vs passenger expression)

Why it matters for CAR-T:

High expression increases killing efficiency

Low normal-tissue expression reduces on-target/off-tumor toxicity

Decision enabled:

Is the antigen sufficiently tumor-selective at the transcript level?

##################
#####3 Single-cell RNA-seq – Cell-type specificity and heterogeneity

Purpose:
To assess which cell types actually express the antigen and whether expression is heterogeneous.

What we evaluate:

Expression in malignant vs immune vs stromal cells

Fraction of tumor cells expressing the antigen

Presence of antigen-negative tumor subpopulations

Why it matters for CAR-T:

Antigen heterogeneity → escape risk

Expression on immune or stromal cells → safety risk

Decision enabled:

Is antigen expression confined to tumor cells and sufficiently uniform?

################
######4 Proteomics / Surfaceome – Physical accessibility to CAR

Purpose:
To confirm that the antigen is present on the cell surface and accessible to antibody binding.

What we evaluate:

Protein-level expression

Surface localization and extracellular domains

Discrepancies between RNA and protein

Why it matters for CAR-T:

CARs recognize surface proteins only

RNA expression does not guarantee surface availability

Decision enabled:

Is the antigen physically targetable by a CAR?

####################
######5 Bulk BCR-seq – Antibody repertoire discovery

Purpose:
To identify expanded B-cell clonotypes that may encode antibodies recognizing the tumor antigen.

What we evaluate:

Expanded BCR clonotypes

V(D)J usage and CDR3 diversity

Evidence of antigen-driven selection

Why it matters for CAR-T:

BCRs provide natural antibody sequences

These antibodies can be converted into CAR recognition domains

Decision enabled:

Which antibody lineages are worth pursuing for CAR design?

#######################
########6 scBCR + scRNA-seq – Functional validation and chain pairing

Purpose:
To link antibody sequence with B-cell functional state at single-cell resolution.

What we evaluate:

Correct heavy/light chain pairing

Memory or plasma-cell phenotypes

Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation

Why it matters for CAR-T:

Correct chain pairing is essential for binding

Antigen-experienced B cells yield higher-quality antibodies

Decision enabled:

Which antibody sequences are functional and engineerable?

#########################
####7 scFv Design – CAR recognition module engineering

Purpose:
To convert antibody variable regions into a stable, functional CAR binding domain.

What we evaluate:

VH/VL orientation

Linker length and flexibility

Stability, aggregation risk, and expression

Why it matters for CAR-T:

Poor scFv design leads to tonic signaling or CAR instability

This step bridges computation and protein engineering

Decision enabled:

Which antibody sequence becomes the CAR targeting domain?
